Jenkins
-------
Jenkins is an open source, java based CI(continuous integration) tool. Jenkins software developed using Java language.
Jenkins paid version is Hudson developed by oracle in 2004.Jenkins free version is jenkins developed by jenkins community in 2012.
By default, Jenkins listens on port 8080.

What is CI?
-----------
CI stands for continuous integration.
CI is the process of automating the build and testing the source code every time when developers push code to the version control system.

Tools used in CI
----------------
GitHub
Maven
SonarQube
Nexus
Jenkins

After developer push code to github jenkins pull code and execute unit test cases using maven server,execute sonarqube report and 
upload into sonarqube server,build artifacts using maven and finally upload artifacts to nexus server is complete CI process.

CI Benifits
-----------
Immediate bug detection and get rectified fast so the entire sdlc happens fast.
No human integration step on the SDLC
Can deploy at any give time

What is CD?
-----------
CD stands for continuous delivery or deployment.
For production deployment we manually triggering the job is called continuous delivery.
continuous delivery model we use for external projects(Client)
Hand overing end product to client.

For production deployment automatically triggering the job is called continuous deployment.
continuous deployment module we use for in house projects.

CI Tools
--------
Jenkins
Hudson
Bamboo

Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8080" --> Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8090"

systemctl daemon-reload


Views
-----
In real-time jenkins server has 100+ jobs are there for multiple projects. 
You can create separate view for your job. eg. facebook related Job in one view, myntra related job in one view.

Deleting view doesn't mean that to delete job.


Jenkins Security
----------------
Providing access of jenkins server to devloper and devops engineer we create user.

Click on Manage Jenkins --> Click on Manage Users --> Create User --> Provide User Name, Password, Full Name and Email ID.

Jenkins Backup
--------------
First install one plugin called as "ThinBackup".

Create directory to store backup (At any location you can create)
# cd /var/lib/jenkins
# mkdir jenkins_backup
# chown -R jenkins:jenkins jenkins_backup

Click on Manage Jenkins --> Click on ThinBackup in bottom --> click on settings --> Provide backup direcotry as above created directory path -->
Provide Max number of backup sets (you can give any) --> Select options of your choise --> Click on Save

Now if you click on backup now it will take backup of your jenkins server.

If you don't want to click manually. Provide cronjob in settings for Backup schedule for full backups OR Backup schedule for differential backups.


Create a CI/CD for Java Project using Pipeline Project Type - Scripted Way
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Click on New Item --> Provide Job Name (Projet Name + Environment) facebook-dev-scripted --> Select pipeline project --> Click on Ok 
Provide Descriptions(Optional) "CIntegration and CDeployment for facebook application in dev environment".

Here def is keyword to declare a variable, mavenhome is variable name.
If you are using maven through global tool configuration then you have to declare a variable which having mavne version name.

Below stage syntax will work when you install maven in jenkins server
    stage('Build'){
        sh "mvn clean package"
    }

Here instage of CheckoutCode, Build .... you can give any name for stage identification.

To copy file from one server to another server we use SCP command.To achive this using jenkins,First install one plugin called as "SSH Agent".
To copy file from one server to another server we need user name and password of target sever.
Either use user name and password or use username and .pem file.

Under kind select SSH username with privete key --> provide username and select primary key enter directly radio button --> provide primary key --> 
Click on Add.

Provide write access to others or full access to webapps directory of tomcat
# chmod -R 757  webapps/


By default script is going to run on matser instance. If you want to specify node/slave name specify like below syntax.

node('node1'){

stage("StageName"){

 }
}

// --> for single line comment

/*

for multiple line comment.

*/ 

Create a CI/CD for Java Project using Pipeline Project Type - Declarative Way
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Click on New Item --> Provide Job Name (Projet Name + Environment) facebook-dev-declarative --> Select pipeline project --> Click on Ok 
Provide Descriptions(Optional) "CIntegration and CDeployment for facebook application in dev environment".

By default script is going to run on matser instance. If you want to specify node/slave name specify like below syntax.

pipeline{
    agent any

/*
agent{
    lable 'nodename'
}
*/

}

MultiBranch Pipeline (Optional)
-------------------------------


Build With Parameters
---------------------
If you want to pass parameters dynamically while running the job we are going to use BWP.

Click on General --> Select This project is parameterized --> Click on Add Parameter --> Choice Parameter --> Provide name any (branchname) -->
Provide Choices (development, qa, uat)

Now insted of branch name in frestyle or Maven project type use ${branchname} and scripted project type use ${params.branchname}

 
Jenkins Master Slave Architecture
---------------------------------
If you have 100 job in master instance and if you trigger all jobs it will take lots of time to complete the execution of job.
Insted of that we can create slave/node/instances and distribute jobs based upon the server configuration of slave,
so it will take less time to complete the execution of job and improve the performance.

Job information is stored/available in master only and job sc is stored in slave only.
We will not install jenkis in slave instance, we install java only in slave instance.
We can create slave in any of the OS.

Note: In the real-time we create slaves in another linux server only.

Prerequisites of slave Instance
-------------------------------
Java 8 or 11 (JDK) and git is the pre-requisite Software for slave instance.

Launch linux EC2 with SSH(22) port.
Login as a root user and update server
$ sudo su -
# yum update -y

Instal Java and git
# yum install java-11-openjdk git -y

To check jre version
# java -version  

# exit

Create directory to store node information
$ mkdir slave1
$ cd slave1
$ pwd slave1
/home/ec2-user/slave1

To create slave in jenkins master
--------------------------------- 
Click on Manage Jenkins --> Click on Manage Nodes and Clouds --> Click on New Node --> Provide Node name any (slave1) --> Select Permanent Agent --> 
Click on Create --> Provide Description (Optional) --> Provide Number of executors --> Provide Remote root directory as 
directory path we created in slave instance (/home/ec2-user/slave1) --> Provide Labels (anyname) --> Select Launch method as Launch agents via SSH -->
Provide Host as public or private IP of slave instance --> Select user name and password or add user name and password --> 
Select SSH username with privete key --> provide username and select primary key enter directly radio button --> provide primary key --> Click on Add -->
Select Host Key Verification Strategy as Manually trusted key Verification Strategy --> Select Availability as Keep this agent online as much as possible 
--> Click on Save.


To configure slave in job
------------------------
Click on General --> Select Restrict where this project can be run --> Provide Label Expression (slaves)

Note : Based on Number of executors we can deside how many job slave can run at one time.Default value is 1
       Using Labels name master can assign specific job to specific slave.



Jenkins CLI (Session 9)
-----------------------

download jenkins-cli.jar
exwcute below command in gitbash
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://3.110.80.149:8080/ -webSocket help


Migration (Session 9)
---------------------

Create a CI/CD for NodeJS Project using Pipeline Project Type - Scripted Way
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
First install one plugin called as "NodeJs" and cofigure NodeJS version in GTC just like maven.




Create a CI/CD for NodeJS Project using Pipeline Project Type - Declarative Way
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Related/Linked Jobs
---------------------
We are having two types of Linked job

1) Downstream 
After first job complete second job start,
We need to mention second job name in first job.( You can mention any number of job by using comma , )

Post-build action --> Select build other projects --> Provide the second job name.

2) Upstream
After first job complete second job start,
We need to mention first job name in second job.

Build Trigger --> Select Build after other projects are built --> Provide first job name.

facebok-dev --> upstream job for qa

facebook-qa --> downstream job for dev and upstream job for prod

facebook-prod --> downstream job for qa
