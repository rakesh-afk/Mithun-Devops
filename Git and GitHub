Git is a distributed version control system.
GitHub is a centralized repository or remote repository or storage.

Note : In real-time we are going to use the enterprise edition of github.

As a devops engineer we are responsible to do admin activity as follows when a new project is onboarded.

1. As a devops engineer we are responsible to create an organization(it is like a boundary) so that outsiders can not access our code.

organization url : https://github.com/rahulss-ec-project

2. As a devops engineer we are responsible to create a repository in scm for each project with project name and share the repository url
with the development team. Repository is the place where we store the code.

repository url : https://github.com/rahulss-ec-project/facebook.git
                 https://github.com/rahulss-ec-project/amazon.git
       
Note : In the real-time we are going to create a private repository.

3. As a devops engineer we are responsible to create a team(groupe), add resources(developer) to the team and provide repository access to the team.
So that developer can't access code from other repository projects.

team url : https://github.com/orgs/rahulss-ec-project/teams/facebook-devteam

Note: Based on requirement we can create n numbers of repositories for the same project.

Git Commands
------------

Note : In real-time mostly we download git bash in windows.

Create a Linux EC2 instance with an SSH port.

Update EC2 Instance.
# yum update -y.

Install git package.
# yum install git -y.

Create a director with a Project name.
# mkdir facebook

Change directory to facebook.
# cd facebook

Run the git init command(git initialize) inside the facebook director.
#git init

As soon as you run # git init command directory will be converted into empty git local repository,
One hidden directory will created with name .git which is nothing but a empty git local repository,
and directory converted into three different logical areas or stages which you cannot see.

Provide any username and mail ID using the following command brefore FIRST COMMIT.
# git config --global use.name "rahul3738"
# git config --global user.email "rahul@gmail.com"

To see username and mail ID use following command
# git config --global --list


Working Area/Untracked file        
---------------------------
By Default file is created in the working area.
You can write and update the file in the working area.
If you create the file,update the file by default the file is available in the working area.

If you want to check the status of a file using the following command.
# git status

Untracked file (In Red Color)

Once development is completed we are going to move files from the working area to staging area.
To move code from the working area to the staging area is called add.

# git add .  --> move all file
# git add *  --> move all file
# git add *.java  --> move file only having .java extension
# git add myfile1  --> move only specific file
         
Staging Area           
------------            

If you want to check the status of the file using the following command.
# git status

Changes to be committed (file is in staging area file name with green color)

Move code from Staging area to local repository process of moving code to local repository is called as commit.

# git commit -m "any message you can give" --> move all file
# git commit -m "My first commit of myfile1" myfile1 --> move only specific file

Local Repository
----------------

If you want to check the status of file using following command
# git status

To Move code from git local repository to github remote repository is called as push.
But before push code to github remote repository, make sure that you are connected to github remote repository.

To check github connection
# git remote -v

To connect github remote repository to git local repository is called as add.
# git remote add facebook https://github.com/rahulss-ec-project/facebook.git

Here facebook is an alias name to github remote repository url,you can use any name eg.project name.

To Move code from git local repository to github remote repository
# git push facebook master

Here master is the github remote repository branch name where we are moving our code from git local repository master branch.

If you modify any already commited file and you want to add and commit the file at same time use below command
# git commit -a -m "updated..."

What is the command to check how many commits you did in the local repository? or to check username, mail ID, date, time and commit msg
# git log

To see recent commit
# git log -1 

To see last two recent commit
# git log -2

To see all commit in one line
# git log --oneline

To check one perticular commit ID or to check data inside that file
# git show <Commit id>

To check file name in perticular commit ID
# git show --pretty="" --name-only <Commit id>

To search a particular commit containing the below word in a comment then use the following command.
# git log --grep "London"

Git reset
---------
After moving the file to the staging area if you want to undo/remove file from Staging area then we go for the reset concept.
Reset concept work after add and before commit.

# git reset .  --> remove all
# git reset *  --> remove all
# git reset *.java   --> remove file only having .java extension
# git reset myfile1  --> remove only specific file

To remove file from both Working area as well as Staging area use below command

# git reset --hard .  --> remove all
# git reset --hard *  --> remove all
# git reset --hard *.java   --> remove file only having .java extension
# git reset --hard myfile1  --> remove only specific file

Git revert
----------
Revert concept work after commit.

Scenario: You have created test.py and test.cs files and also modified the already commited file Deploy.sh.
          changes are pushed to github remote repository.Due to your push build failing.
          Now you have to remove test.py and test.cs and undo the changes from Deploy.sh.
 
          In such cases we go for the git revert concept.

# git revert <CI>

After running above command in your local repository.
 deploy.sh updated code removed
 delete test.cs
 delete test.py
Now push changes to github remote repository
# git push facebook master -f

How to remove an untracked file?
--------------------------------
Untracked file = file not being added to staging area and committed in local repository is called an untracked file.
Or file is only present in workspace.

To list untracked files
# git clean -n

To remove all untracked files
# git clean -f

To remove Specific untracked file
# git clean -f myfile10

Git Ignore Files
----------------
Sometimes we don't want to commit files, which are generated by IDE like .project and.classpath
or node module folders like node_modules into a git remote repository.
To ignore these files and the folder to commit we will create one hidden file called .gitignore and
we will keep those files and directory names which we don't want to commit.

# vim .gitignore
.project
.classpath
/node_modules

# git add . .gitignore
# git commit -m "ignored files and folders"
# git push facebook master

Branches
--------
Branch concept is useful for parallel development.
You can create any number of branches.
master/main is default branch.

To see a local repository branch name use following command
# git branch

To see a remote repository branch use of following command
# git branch -r

To see a local as well as remote repository branch use of following command
# git branch -a

To create new branch use following command
# git branch development

Note : * represent your current branch

To switch branch use following command
# git checkout development

To create new branch and To switch branch at same time use following command
# git checkout -b stage

If you create a new file or modify any file in your new branch and forget to add and commit then,
that file or changes are visible in each and every other branch until you commit that file in your new branch.

Note: Working area is common for both master and development branch

File created or modified in the working area will be visible in any of the branch working areas until you commit that file.
Once you commit that file then that file belong to that particular branch.

You should not switch to another branch unless you commit your work in the current branch.

Branch Merging
--------------
It is a pull mechanism or copy paste mechanism. Being present in one branch copy and paste the data of another branch or vice versa.

eg. development branch merging with master branch.

To merge branch use following command
# git merge development

Here being present in master branch copy and paste development branch data.

When you are having the same file name in both branches and different data inside those files and
trying to merge a development branch with the master branch then merge conflicts occur.
If data is the same inside those files, no conflict.

You need to manually fix that particular file in a master branch, with the help of the developer and commit the file.

To check differences between two branches use the following command.
# git diff development

Here the master branch is compared with the development branch.

# git diff development stage

Here stage branch is compared with development branch

Note : if you do not mention the second branch name it will consider comparison with the present branch.

To push all branches from local to remote repository use following command
# git push facebook --all

Here facebook is the alias name to github remote repository url.

To push specific branch from local to remote repository use following command
# git push facebook master stage

Here facebook is the alias name to github remote repository url.

To delete a local repository branch use of following command
# git branch -d stage

Note : Being present in the branch(stage) you can't delete the same branch(stage).

To delete a remote repository branch use of following command
# git push facebook :stage

Here facebook is the alias name to github remote repository url.

To change the branch name use following command
# git branch -M main

Here the master branch is renamed to the main branch.

Git Tag
-------
Tag is a meaningful name given to the last commit id of the production branch which we are going to deploy.
In real-time we create tags on master/production branch after production deployment for a particular release.

To see a tag name use following command
# git tag

To create a tag name use following command
# git tag <tagname>
eg. # git tag facebookv1.0.0
here facebook is project name
     1 is majour release
     0 is minor release
     0 is pach/bug fix release

To delete a tag name use following command
# git tag -d <tagname>

To push a tag name to github remote repository use following command
# git push facebook tag <tagname>

To push a all tag name to github remote repository use following command
# git push facebook --tags

Note : Here facebook is the alias name to github remote repository url.

With # git tag command you can create .zip and .tar.gz files in github remote repository.

Git Stash
---------
Git stash is a temporary storage in your git local repository.

Scenario: You are working on test.py files in the development branch, suddenly you got one bug fix ticket for the production/master branch.
          You are in the middle of the development on the test.py file. You can't commit that file right away.
          You have to switch to the master branch and fix the issue. 

          You should not switch to another branch unless you commit your work in the current branch.         

          In such cases we go for the stash concept.

          Move test.py file code in stash memory for the time being and start working on the master branch issued after the issue is resolved, 
          bring back your half done code from stash memory and start working on it.

Recommended : First add and commit empty file before using for stash concept. or you have to add file to staging are then only you can use for stash . 

To move your code to stash storage use the following Command.
# git stash

To check stash storage use the following Command.
# git stash list

Stash@{0} recently added new
Stash@{1} previously added old
Stash@{2} previously added old

To bring back code from stash use the following Command.
# git stash apply

Above command will bring back latest changes Stash@{0}. If you want specific code use the following Command
# git stash apply Stash@{1}

To delete specific stash use the following command.
# git stash drop Stash@{1}

To apply and delete specific stash in single command use the following command.
# git stash pop

If you want specific
# git stash pop Stash@{1}

To clear complete stash use the following command.
# git stash clear

When you send data from file to stash it is cut and paste, when you bring back your data from stash to file it is copy and paste.

Git cherry-pick
---------------
To get/integrate specific commit code with your branch we use cherry-pick command or to merge specific commit with your branch.
# git cherry-pick <CI>

What code is availabe in CI will get merge with current branch.

Git clone
---------
It creates a local repository automatically with the same name as GitHub remote repository.
Clone concept is used when your GitHub remote repository is already present.

To clone github repository use the following command
# git clone <github url>

Git fetch
---------
When you run git fetch, updated code will get in local repo not getting working copy of files.

# git fetch origin master

Remote Repository 
      |
      | git fetch
      |
      v
Local Repository 



To get working copy need to run git merge command.
# git merge origin master

Remote Repository 
      |
      | git fetch
      |
      v
Local Repository 
      |
      | git merge
      |
      v
Working Area


Git pull
---------
To get updated code from remote repository 
 git pull =  git fetch +  git merge

# git pull origin master


**"THIS IS THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU GET GIT AND GUTHUB ACCESS"**

How to push and pull files in central repo without credentials????
SSH Key
-------
Need to generate key in system using following command
# ssh-keygen |_> |_>

Now copy this key from ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file to github remote repository 
Go to user setting 
Click on ssh and gpg key
Click on new ssh key 
Provide title any name/project name
Past that key here
Click on add SSH key

ssh -T git@github.com

Note : In the real-time used company enterprise edition url instead of github.com 

Now add ssh url in git local repository
# git remote add origin git@github.com:rahulss-ec-project/facebook.git

Here origin is an alias name to github remote repository ssh url,you can use any name eg.project name.

To get code from github remote repository to git local repository
# git pull origin master

Here master is the github remote repository branch name, from which we are moving our code from git local repository master branch.


PAT --> Personal Access Token
-----------------------------
Insted of using password to connect to github we use PAT.
PAT is generated in github.

Click on Settings --> Developer settings --> Personal access tokens --> Generate Token --> Token Name(any)
Click on generate token and copy immidately. -->  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



PR  --> Pull Request
--------------------
If you want to integrate one brach code with another branch in git local repository we use merge command.
Same way if you want to integrate one brach code with another branch in github remote repository we use pull request.

Senario : merge stage branch with master branch in github remote repository.

Create Pull Request in master branch.
Click on new pull request.
Select branches master to stage.
Click on Create pull request
Click on Create pull request

Once you create pull request copy pr url and share with senior devloper or devops enginer to review you code.
https://github.com/rahulss-ec-project/facebook/pull/1

Once you get approval you can merge. 

Fork
---- 
Copy github remote repository to another github account.


Branching Strategy
------------------
What are all the branches we have created for our project's successful development and deployment is called a branching strategy.
Branching strategy is not fixed, it varies project to project and company to company based on environment(dev,qa,prod....).

Development branch      --> Dev
Stage branch            --> QA
Master branch           --> Production

                           Above environment is fixed.
                           After QA we can add one more UAT (user acceptance test) environment for clients to test.
                           Before production we can add one more SIT (system integration test) environment = production.


Note : Each developer has his own branch and after code completion he creates PR to integrate with the development branch.

If we face any issue in production, we directly start working on the production environment.we create a branch called bugfix_bg (bg = bug name)
on top of the master branch.
We integrate bugfix_bg with development and deploy to the dev environment,then QA and finally in PRO.We are not going to deploy directly to PRO.

If a client has requirement to add one functionality in production on priority,we directly start working on the production environment.
we create a branch called feature_fn (fn = function name) on top of the master branch.
We integrate feature_fn with development and deploy to the dev environment,then QA and finally in PRO.We are not going to deploy directly to PRO.

After work is done we delete bugfix_bg or feature_fn branches.
